A Graphical User Interface (GUI) built around [PySimAI](https://simai.docs.pyansys.com/).

### Install instructions
The tool uses the open-source Python framework [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/#).

First, download and extract the repository as a zip file to your own (local) computer.

Then, install all the packages listed in the *requirements.txt* file by using the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, use:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

As soon as you run the command as shown above, a local Streamlit server will spin up and the tool will open in a new tab in your default web browser.
